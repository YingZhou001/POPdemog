The script ms.py converts the demographic model specified in msprime to the ms format.

Usage: python ms.py [demofile] [population_configurations] [migration_matrix] [demographic_events]
where
  [demofile] = input python file which specified the demographic model in msprime format
  [population_configurations] = name of the variable for population_configurations in msprime
  [migration_matrix] = name of the variable for migration_matrix in msprime
  [demographic_events] = name of the variable for demographic_events in msprime

The reference effective population size is set as 10,000.
The sample size for each subpopulation is set as 1 since it is irrelevant here.

An example is provided here:

python msprime2ms.py demo1.py population_configurations migration_matrix demographic_events > msprime.demo.cmd
